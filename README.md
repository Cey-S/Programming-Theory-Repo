âœ¨ The goal of the game is to gather quest items from trees and submit them to the quest board to get coins. ðŸŒ³ There are two types of trees: Wood trees and Food trees. Wood trees have a finite amount of items, while Food trees produce items at a fixed rate. Both trees inherit from the same base class.  

ðŸŒ± In this game prototype:
- I studied and implemented Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles,
- Implemented an Inventory System,
- Implemented a Quest System.

ðŸŽ® How to play:
- You can move the player using WASD
- The "I" shortcut key opens the player's inventory.
- The Quest Board and trees use raycasting; you can click on them to open their respective UI panels.
- You can drag and drop the items between slots.
